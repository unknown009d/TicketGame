# Lottery Ticket Game 🏆
##### *Wont get any real prizes though*
 
This was a simple super fast practice project of creating an lottery game. So i came up with this idea of creating a ticket. These tickets were made using [figma](https://figma.com), and imported to code using SVG. 

It contains no backend, it is solely focused on User Interface/Experience. Also, it is a single page application there's no redirections on this page.

This contains plain html, css and a small sprinkle of javascript. You can visit the github pages https://unknown009d.github.io/TicketGame/

# How to use
> Although there's no such use, it's one of the most basic websites but just incase if you need (Just trying to improve markdown skills (•◡•) )

Visit the [page](https://unknown009d.github.io/TicketGame/) and select any ticket, it will highlight itself, if you are satisfied with the ticket proceed using pressing Find out the lucky number. A final result page will open which has a gif image of a winner or loser depending on the random ticket number.
